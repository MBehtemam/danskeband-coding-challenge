- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The specification covers 5 user stories across 3 priority levels (P1, P2, P3).
- 14 functional requirements defined with testable acceptance criteria.
- 7 success criteria defined with measurable outcomes.
- Assumptions documented to clarify design decisions.
